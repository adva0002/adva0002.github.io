        <h1>MY MOTIVATION FOR CHOOSING THE HBO-ICT PROGRAMME</h1>
        <p>Technology was introduced to me at a tender age. 
            With technology evolving rapidly, the world requires computer specialists because they are an integral part of our daily lives as it is always in demand.</p>
        <p>As a result, this has really convinced me to pursue a career in ICT because it helps to improve productivity, output and efficiency. 
            I am also genuinely interested in learning ICT because it allows me to learn new things such as: web development, computer programming, hardware skills and collaborating online for work and feedback and adapting to new things because ICT is always growing and changing.
            In the future I aspire to be either a Software Engineer, Business IT Consultant or even a Data Scientist.
            <br><br>
            Another reason why I am motivated for this study program is that it will improve my personal development such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>enhancing my critical and analytical thinking skills, that I believe, will aid me in solving challenging problems. </li>
            <li>exhibiting my creativity</li>
            <li>making the right decisions</li>
            <li>remaining open-minded</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given the fantastic career opportunities avaliable in the ICT field, I would love to graduate with my ICT degree and work in any part of the world.</p>
