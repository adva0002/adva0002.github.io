        Dear Varsha,
        <br>
        Welcome to our program and thank you for submitting the who am I form. You write about doing research into technology. What specifically did you research? Also, I'd gather you made your own website can we see that online, or was it a school project? I am curious.  You have a broad interest in IT but it seems you like to focus most on security. Our program educates more general but it might be an idea to have an IT security minor or internship.  What type of companies in IT do you know who you would like to work for? 
        <br>
        What do you think enhancing critical and analytical skills will bring you? Good to read you have good organizational skills. When studying abroad a lot must be planned and with our college planning is one of the skills which will help you greatly. Keep in mind that if you are not fond of working in teams, our program can become a challenge. Not in the first quartile where your work is mostly individual but after that the entire program is focused on Group work.  Your future IT job probably too!
        <br>
        Sometimes the class workshops can be chaotic, If you need some quiet space to unwind know you can find yourself a quiet project room to retreat to.  I tend to do that too! Looking forward to exchanging recipes for nice meals!
        <br>
        I hope to meet you at our information sessions and see you at the new school year. 
        <br>
        Kind regards,
        <br>
        Daphne
