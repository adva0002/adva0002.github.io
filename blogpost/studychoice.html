                <p class="study">At a tender age, I was introduced to technology. <br>I did my own research and I am genuinely interested in technology. <br>It has enhanced my analytical and thinking skills. With technology evolving rapdily, I got the opportunity to design a website which also helped me to display my creativity.<br>  Thus, it has persuaded me to pursue my career ICT with a hope to find an occupation within that field. Either that being a Software Engineer, Data Scientist or even a Business Consultant. 
                    I would like to use my skills and knowledge in ICT to help businesses examine and secure their data as safe as possible.  </p>
