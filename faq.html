                <li>What are the instructions if you want to park your car at the HZ parking lot?</li>
                <p>Answer:
                    Free parking is possible on the car park of PZEM at the Poelendaelesingel 10 in Middelburg. This is a few minutes' walk to the HZ. 
                    Unfortunately, it is <b>not</b> possible to park directly at the HZ building. However, there are two disabled parking spaces and spaces for HZ cars near the building self.
                </p>
                <p>Please note: if you park at the Poelendaelesingel, you cannot reach the HZ via the tunnel because of the construction works for the Joint Research Center Zeeland. You can cross over via the intersection at the traffic lights.</p>
