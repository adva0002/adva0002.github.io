            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is <b>Varsha Advani</b>! I am eighteen (18) years old.
                <br><br>
                I was born and raised on the beautiful and friendly island of <b><i>Sint Maarten.</i></b> 
                I attended the St.Maarten Academy Highschool-Caribbean Secondary Education.
            </p>
            <p><b>Fun fact: Sint Maarten is the smallest island in the world with two different countries:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>French</li>
                <li>Dutch</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some of the subjects that I studied were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information Technology</li>
                <li>Accounting</li>
                <li>Principles of Business</li>
                <li>Electronic Document Preparation and Management</li>
                <li>Mathematics</li>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>Geography</li>
                <li>Integrated Science</li>

                <li>Communication Studies at CAPE level</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (e.g.student job and leisure)</h2>
            <p>While studying, I do intend to work so that I can get an experience of how it is. 
                I do hope that in the future I will be able to work in the ICT sector, perhaps for <b>Apple, Samsung or Microsoft Office.</b></p>
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, cooking/experimenting with new recipes, going to the beach, spending time with my family members.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I utilize my spare time to conduct some ICT research, such as learning how to use the various computer programs, applications and softwares that I believe will be able to help me execute some of the things I have learned for various occassions. </p>
